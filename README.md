All settings are stored in `config.json`. Key sections include:

## General

- `output_dir` (string): Directory where the processed clips will be saved.  
- `log_filename` (string): Name of the file where logs will be written.  
- `filename_template` (string): Template for output filenames.  
- `cloud` (bool): If true, enables cloud-related features and will not work normally.  
- `overwrite` (bool): If true, existing audio files will be overwritten.  
- `parallel_workers` (int): Number of audio downloads/processing tasks to run in parallel.  
- `default_clip_duration_seconds` (int): Length of each trimmed audio clip.  
- `max_download_retries` (int): Number of retry attempts for failed downloads.  
- `retry_delay_seconds` (int): Delay (in seconds) between download retries.  
- `file` (string): Path to the CSV file to use for batch processing.

## Audio Settings (`audio_settings`)

- `format` (string): Output file format, such as `mp3` or `wav`.  
- `bitrate` (string): Desired bitrate for the audio output.  
- `sample_rate` (int): Target sample rate for the audio in Hz.  
- `target_dBFS` (float): Target loudness level for normalization in decibels.  
- `fade_in` / `fade_out` (bool): Whether to apply fade effects at the beginning/end.  
- `fade_in_duration_ms` / `fade_out_duration_ms` (int): Duration of fade effects in milliseconds.  
- `normalize` (bool): Whether to normalize the volume of the audio.

*Tip:* Adjust these values in the `config.json` file to suit your needs.

## üìë CSV Format

| Column Header             | Purpose                                                                                     |

| **Name**                  | The person's first name. Used for naming and identification.                               |
| **Surname**               | The person's last name. Used together with the first name for unique identification.       |
| **Song (Title & Artist)** | The full song title and artist name. This is used to search for the correct audio track.   |
| **Start Time (MM:SS)**    | The time offset in the song where the clip should start. Format must be minutes and seconds.|

## üöÄ Usage

1. Place your CSV file in the project folder (e.g., `~/Documents/AudioProcessingScript/playlist.csv`).  

2. Edit `config.json` to match your setup, including `csv_settings.file` and `filename_template`.  

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. (Optional) Use the Streamlit UI:

   ```bash
   streamlit run UI.py
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Setting:**  
> The `cloud` is set to `True` by default in UI.py:

> ```python
> config["cloud"] = config.get("cloud", False)
> ```

> Change this to `False` if you want to enable the local UI.

5. View processed files in the configured output directory.

## üìã Logging

- Logs are saved to the file specified in `log_filename` (default: `processes.log`)  
- Each run creates a fresh log  
- Logs include timestamps, thread info, success markers, and errors
